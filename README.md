This is my coursework answers, I have uploaded the .Rmd file so you can take a look at the code and the .html so you can see the output.

Files you will require are:
LAB_NEN_ODN.clean_BI.ann.3mbChr5.vcf.gz
C_excelsa_V5_braker2_wRseq.gff3
(provided in the coursework files in moodle)

nano_ODN_population.txt
nano_NEN_population.txt
nano_LAB_population.txt
#which are all the sample headers per population to run the vcftools

NEN_LAB_out_windowed_weir_fst.csv
NEN_ODN_out_windowed_weir_fst_500.csv
ODN_LAB_out_windowed_weir_fst_500.csv
#these are just my outputted weir fst which I changed the location and name of but it should automatically save and then used the outputted file

#just n.b. if there are any warnings when running this code you may need to change the file path and/or name of the file as this only works to my directory and file names
